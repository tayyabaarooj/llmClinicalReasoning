# MIMIC-Based Clinical Reasoning with Chain-of-Thought LLM

This repository contains the code and resources developed\used during my internship at the Medical Imaging and Diagnostics Lab (National Center of Artificial Intelligence). The project explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to perform clinical reasoning on the MIMIC dataset.

## üß† Project Description

Use LLMs to reason over MIMIC-III/IV clinical notes, mimicking physician-style reasoning. The model will: 
‚óè Take a clinical summary (structured/unstructured). 

‚óè Use Chain-of-Thought prompting to reason over symptoms and suggest diagnoses. 

## üß† Project Highlights

- Utilized MIMIC-III/IV dataset for clinical case reasoning
- Chain-of-Thought prompting to improve reasoning accuracy
- Baseline vs CoT prompt comparison
- LLMs used: OpenAI GPT-4 / LLaMA 
- Evaluation via [exact match, BLEU]

## üìÅ Dataset used:

Since MIMIC-III/IV dataset is huge, so we will be using the small version of it provided by Indiana University.

## üß† Principal Investigator

This project was conducted under the supervision of **Dr. Tehseen Zia**, Associate Professor at COMSATS University.
